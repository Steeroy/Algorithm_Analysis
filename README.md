<br/>

## This is an algorithm analysis exercise with Contact Tracing and Custom Sequence both written in Java language
<br/>

### Contact Tracing
This program checks if two babies are in the creche simultaneously. If baby 1 has an arrival time of 14:00 and departure time of 16:00, and baby 2 has an arrival time of 15:00 and departure time of 16:00, then baby 1 and 2 make a pair that was in the creche simultaneously.
